    export each mesh part data as struct
    in list
    
    export the object transform (as matrix)
    export 'poses'
        (set of key:matrix pairs)
    
    make it a real object format
        put all binary data in one file
        store data offsets
        put information in 'header'
        compress the binary data? lol
    
need a quaternion lerp

parse the binary data in C
batch mesh data
load object transforms
render objects

do parenting

do shaders
    vert shader is same
    frag shader
        static directional light
        static ambient light
        flat shading (gouraud shading)
        
white background
make mech rotate
